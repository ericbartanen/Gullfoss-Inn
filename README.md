# Gullfoss Inn

<i>Group project originally completed by Eric Bartanen and Amrit Bola for OSU's CS program.</i>

This database-driven web app is a reservation system for the staff at Gullfoss Inn, an imaginary hotel near Gullfoss Falls in Iceland. 

There are three main functions:

<ul>
    <li> Managing Reservations </li>
    <li> Managing Rooms </li>
    <li> Managing Staff </li>
</ul>

## Managing Reservations

Create individual guests and bookings. To make a booking for a guest, the guest must be created first then chosen from the dropdown while making a booking. 

## Managing Rooms

Create a room type, which can apply to many different rooms. The price of a given room is based on its room type. You can then assign a room a room number and room type. 

A room must be created first in order to use it in a booking.

## Managing Staff

Enter staff member details, including their job title and hourly pay. You can then assign them specific rooms for which they're responsible.
